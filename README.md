##Introduction to RP2040
The Datasheet is a good way to gain more knowledge about RP2040 if it's new for you. 
RP2040 is a high-performance microcontroller device. which is really affordable with a price range of 4$ (Rasbery pi 2040 Pico) and 9.95$ (Adafruit QTPy 2040). For this setup we will be using the Adafruit QTPy 2040. 
You can check out the prcises using the following links:

*Key features of RP2040 are listed below:*
• Dual ARM Cortex-M0+ @ 133MHz
• In six independent banks 264kB on-chip SRAM 
• DMA controller
• AHB crossbar Fully-connected 
• 30 GPIO pins, 4 of which have analogue inputs
• peripherals for Interpolator and integer divider
• Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus
• To generate core voltage On-chip programmable LDO 
• To generate core clocks and USB, 2 on-chip PLLs
• Peripherals: I2C controllers **2**, UARTs **2**, PWM channels **16**, SPI controllers **2**, PIO state machines **8**

##Setup Steps:

###Step 1 :
Download all the required files. For that I followed the Chapter **9.2 Building on MS Windows** of the Getting started with Pico Guide.

##Step 2 :
Downloading and Installing all the Softwares. I referred the above mentioned youtube video in the resourses for the same.
